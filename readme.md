# Interactive Particle Canvas

Welcome to the Interactive Particle Canvas project! This project is a dynamic web-based visual experience where particles move and interact based on user input. Built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, the project offers several interactive modes and effects that allow users to engage with the canvas in creative ways.

## Features

- **Particle Trails**: Follow the mouse cursor with particles leaving a colorful trail.
- **Gravity Mode**: Simulate gravitational forces on the particles, causing them to fall and bounce.
- **Attraction Mode**: Particles are attracted towards the mouse cursor, creating an effect similar to gravitational pull.
- **Explosive Particle Burst**: Clicking on the canvas generates an explosion of particles that disperse outwards.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background gradient changes over time to add a dynamic effect to the visual experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The canvas adjusts to the screen size, providing an immersive experience on any device.
